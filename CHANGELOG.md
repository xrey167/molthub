### Fixed

### Added
- Web: `/skills` list view with sorting (newest/downloads/stars/name) + quick filter.

- Web: user profile shows avatar + loading state (no "User not found" flash).
- Web: improved mobile responsiveness (nav menu, skill detail layout, install command overflow).
- Web: upload now unwraps folder picks so `SKILL.md` can be at the bundle root.

- CLI: ignore legacy `auth.clawdhub.com` registry and prefer site discovery.

### Changed

## 0.0.3 - 2026-01-04

### Added

- Home: install command switcher (npm/pnpm/bun).

### Fixed

- Repo: mark `clawdhub-schema` as private to prevent publishing.

## 0.0.2 - 2026-01-04

### Added

### Fixed
- CLI sync: dedupe duplicate slugs across scan roots; skip duplicates to avoid double-publish errors.

- CLI sync: prompt only actionable skills; preselect all by default; list synced separately; condensed synced summary when nothing to sync.
- CLI sync: cap long status lists to avoid massive terminal boxes.
- CLI publish/sync: allow empty changelog on updates; registry accepts empty changelog for updates.
- CLI: use `--cli-version` to avoid conflict with skill `--version` flags.
