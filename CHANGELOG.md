# Changelog

## 0.0.4 - Unreleased

## 0.0.3 - 2026-01-04

### Added
- CLI sync: concurrency flag to limit registry checks.

## 0.0.2 - 2026-01-04

### Added

### Fixed
- CLI sync: dedupe duplicate slugs across scan roots; skip duplicates to avoid double-publish errors.

- CLI sync: prompt only actionable skills; preselect all by default; list synced separately; condensed synced summary when nothing to sync.

- CLI publish/sync: allow empty changelog on updates; registry accepts empty changelog for updates.
- CLI: use `--cli-version` to avoid conflict with skill `--version` flags.
